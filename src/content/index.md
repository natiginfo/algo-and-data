Welcome to the Algorithms and Data Structures course!

<Note>This course has a living material, which means it will be published on weekly basis. This includes both the materials and the exercises.</Note>

## If you just want to learn

To attend the course, you do not have to be a student in Centria University of Applied science. All the material and exercises are available online. If you want to get ECTS credits for the course, you have to register to Centria Open University.


## Registering to Open University course

<Note>The open version will be published in May!</Note>

You can register to the course from [TBD](https://tki.centria.fi/koulutus/). This version of the course is open until 15.12.2022 and has only one final deadline at 15.12.2022.


# Learning goals

The list below does not include everything, but exists to give a guideline for students, what to expect each week. This list may extend as the course goes on.

| Part   |      Goal  
|----------|-------------|
| 1| You understand the basics of algorithms and data structures. You understand their meaning in software engineering. |
| 2| You understand time complexity and the *Big O* notation.  |
| 3| You understand recursion and can use it in problem solving. You know of different sorting algorithms and their differences. |
| 4| You know of the *list* and *tree* data structures, especially binary search tree. |
| 5| You understand the basics of *graph* data structures and searching them with *DFS* and *BFS*. |
| 6| You know of Bellman-Ford, Djikstra's and Floyd-Warshall algorithms and understand their basic functionality. |

## Grading

* The course tasks consist of weekly TestMyCode (TMC) exercises. They are all scored, usually 2 points per exercise (more points per larger/more difficult exercise). Each week will have roughly 10 points (some might have 8, some 12), so **60 points in total**.
* A student must get at least 50 % of points to pass the course, and 90 % for grade 5.

|Points | Grade |
|:-----:|:-----:|
| <= 29 |   0   |
| 30-35 |   1   |
| 36-41 |   2   |
| 42-47 |   3   |
| 48-53 |   4   |
| 54-60 |   5   |

At the end of the courses, there is also an exam with **pass / fail** grading. This does not affect the grade but is to ensure that you have done the exercises yourself. More information about the exam will come closer to the exam.
